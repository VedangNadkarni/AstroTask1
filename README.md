# Hubble Images
This repository was created to host the tasks of the Astronomy Club, BITS Pilani
It contains the code to process .fits and .fit files that were sent from the Hubble Space Telescope.
The files can be found in the Hubble archives online. They are too large to be uploaded in this repo.

ðŸ˜… I was too new to python and this was in fact my first experience using jupyter notebooks.
Needless to say I got very confused simply with how to deal with Anaconda, and had absolutely
no knowledge of environments then.

I don't think the dependencies should cause a problem, but sorry of they do.

I will fix this and also update the links to the .fits files from the hubble archive
sometime in the future.
